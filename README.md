# React Redux App Boilerplate

Simple React-Redux App Boilerplate for a quick start.

It has easy initial examples of components, actions and reducers.

## Install and Run the application
- Download repo
- npm install
- npm run dev

With "npm run dev", Webpack will start a new server listening on localhost:8080 serving the app with hot reload enabled.

## Unit testing
Some pre-defined unit tests are ready to illustrate how to run tests against your react components

- npm test

The tests are executed using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) along with [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/), every dependency needed is on the package.json and will be installed on the initial "npm install".

## Next Move
The next step is to add a deeper approach to unit test actions and reducers. All suggestions and pull requests are welcome.
